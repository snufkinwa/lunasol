# LunaSol: A Phaser 3 Game

A simple parallax scrolling game created using Phaser 3. In this game, an astronaut can walk, and run across a moon surface with a parallax background featuring stars and the Earth.

## Features

- **Parallax Scrolling**: Stars and moon surface move at different speeds to create a parallax effect.
- **Character Movement**: The astronaut can walk, run, and jump, with smooth animations for each action.

## Features to be added

- **Collision Handling**: The astronaut collides with the moon surface and cannot leave the bounds of the game world.
- **Jump Mechanic**: The astronaut can only jump when standing on the moon surface and falls back down with gravity.
